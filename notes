try to make a simple cpu to self-teach me about single cycle processor  

First of first, CPU has main operation sequence, namely Fetch, Decode, Execute. Thats all

Fetch is the process of retrieving an instruction from a place, called program memory, where the address is determined by a program counter

Decode operation perform translation of an instruction to a binary signal so that control a part / operation of the cpu (like, do calculation using ALU!)

Execute. U know that. 

So, a simple single cycle CPU has this main part : Registers, ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), Control Unit, Program COunter, isntruction memory, and data memory

First, i gonna create a simple ALU for binary operation like addition and bitwise operation

Will be A, B, Result data, and ALUop (operation signal) there!@

goin to implement it using ‘case’ syntax

update : "wire [3:0] Result;" use wire on testbench because the result is output, and outputs on tesbench are driven by DUT (device under test)
